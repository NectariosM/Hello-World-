Wherever you’re going on holiday, Hotels Fairy is the magical hotel comparison site that will find you the cheapest hotel prices everytime.  Happy Travels!

Hotels Fairy understands that everybody loves to go on holiday.  Whether it’s a romantic weekend away on a grand tour of Europe, good holidays are some of the best days of your life.  But if you’re not careful, the cost of things like hotels and car hire can add up very quickly.  

Not just that, but shopping around different travel agents, visiting different websites and calling hotels to find the best hotel deals is extremely time-consuming.  No wonder then that most holidaymakers end up spending more than they need to on their travels

Simply use our hotel price comparison search boxes to tell us where and when you want to go, and within just a few seconds we will check more than 30 leading travel websites including Hotels.com, Travelocity, Expedia and Laterooms.  We’ll then show you the available rates side by side so that you can make a quick and informed decision about your hotel booking.

When you last went on away on a trip, how did you arrange your accommodation?

Chances are that you found a hotel room on the internet. Perhaps you booked it through an online travel agent (OTA) such as Hotels-Fairy.com, Expedia or Booking.com.

Maybe you checked out hotel reviews on a site such as TripAdvisor.

Or possibly you didn't even consider staying in a hotel, preferring instead to find somewhere to stay via Airbnb or another home-letting company.

All these developments are taking their toll on the traditional hotel industry. But for now, the one that worries hotel bosses most is the increasing power that online travel firms wield over them.

The hotel trade is highly fragmented. The biggest operator worldwide, Intercontinental Hotels Group, has about 4,500 hotels. In contrast, Booking.com lists 500,000 hotels worldwide.

As a result, OTAs are able to charge ever higher levels of commission. If you booked your hotel room through one of them, they could easily be receiving a quarter of the money you paid for it.

Travel providers lure social media stars with special perks, discounts and freebies nowadays. Check-ins on Foursquare or Facebook, tweets, retweets and Instagram posts are traded as currency in exchange for loyalty points or discounted rates. 

In most cases, the more followers you have, the larger your reward. But even an everyday traveler with a less-than-impressive fan base can leverage tweets and likes to save money on travel.

Many of these influencer promotions come and go. Last year, American Airlines gave complimentary airport-lounge passes to passengers with high Klout scores. 

In 2012, United ran a promotion bestowing airline miles upon Foursquare users who checked in at airports. Official tourism boards often run limited-time offers on sites like Pinterest and Facebook; follow your favorite destinations to keep an eye out. 

For the best offers that you can use now, I've focused on active promotions, many of them permanent (or at least semi-permanent) loyalty or reward programs that compensate social media activity.
